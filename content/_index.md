# Introduction to LUA
Lua is a simple and lightweight procedural language with automatic memory management. Because of its simplicity it could be learned even in a week. The idea of this tutorial is to provide brief and structured way to help reduce the learning time.

## Execution environment
The tutorial is using JavaScript Lua VM to execute examples in your browser.
To execute any example, choose Execute button below the sample and the output will be shown on the right of it.

Like on the following example:
{{< lua >}}
print("Hello world!")
{{< /lua >}}
